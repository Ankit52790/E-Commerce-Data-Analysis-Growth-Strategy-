E-Commerce Data Analysis & Growth Strategy 🚀

This repository contains a "data-driven analysis" of an e-commerce business to evaluate profitability, break-even points, and the impact of various market scenarios. The project is part of the "ECommerce Data Champion Assignment" and involves data processing, financial modeling, and strategic decision-making.

📌 Key Objectives:
✔️ Profitability Analysis – Assessing revenue, costs, and profit margins.  
✔️ Break-even Analysis – Determining customer acquisition cost limits.  
✔️ Scenario Testing – Evaluating changes in sales volume, pricing, and fixed costs.  
✔️ Market Strategy – Providing insights to improve financial outcomes.  

📊 Files & Structure:
- 📁 `DT Ecommerce Growth Hacker Assignment.xlsx` → Contains **Task1 & Task2** results with profitability and scenario analysis.  
- 📁 `Task1 & Task2 CSVs` → Raw datasets used for calculations.  
- 📄 `README.md` → Detailed explanation of the project, methodologies, and insights.  
- 📜 `Report.pdf` (Optional) → Structured documentation for easy reference.  

🔍 Key Findings:
- "Break-even CAC" is "$10.50, meaning marketing efforts should keep CAC below this threshold.  
- Increasing the "selling price to $35" boosts profit to "$62,250", demonstrating pricing power.  
- A "5% tax increase reduces profits" by "$10,250", highlighting tax efficiency strategies.  
- Fixed cost management is crucial, as a "$5,000 increase lowers profit by $5,000".  

💡 Recommendations:
✅ Optimize pricing strategies to maximize net margins.  
✅ Focus on cost control, especially fixed costs and tax planning.  
✅ Invest in marketing efforts that maintain sales above 4,000 units.

 🚀 Next Steps:
- Implement "data visualization" for key metrics.  
- Expand the analysis with "competitor benchmarking".  
- Build a "predictive model" to forecast demand & profitability.
